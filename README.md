## 📖 Project Overview
This repository houses the Loan Application Automation process designed using UiPath RPA to streamline and automate the loan application process at UiBank. The solution automates several critical steps in the process, which include handling emails, reading loan application data from CSV/Excel files, entering loan details into a banking application, generating unique Loan IDs, and sending confirmation responses to the business team. By leveraging RPA, this automation significantly reduces the manual intervention required, making the entire loan application process faster, more efficient, and error-free.
